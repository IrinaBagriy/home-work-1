    <h1>Haseki Hurrem Sultan</h1>
    <p>Hurrem Sultan (Turkish pronunciation: [hyɾˈɾæm suɫˈtan], Ottoman Turkish: حرم سلطان‎, romanized: Ḫurrem Sulṭān,
        Modern
        Turkish: Hürrem Sultan; c. 1502 – 15 April 1558), also known as Roxelana (Ukrainian: Роксолана; lit. 'the

        one'), was the chief consort and wife of the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She became one of the most

            <h2>Nurbany Sultan</h2>
            <p>During her nine years of regency (1574–1583), her politics were so pro-Venetian that she was hated by the
                Republic of
                Genoa. Some have even suggested that she was poisoned by a Genoese agent. In any case, she died at the
                palace in the
                Yenikapı Quarter, Istanbul on 7 December 1583.
